## Brainstorm Questions

* Where are max and min Airbnb price?
  * What are average prices?
  * What factors affect prices?
* Where are prices going up and down over time?
* What is the relationship between number of reviews and average review?
* Does room type affect availability?
* What is the location of the unit?
  * What areas are popular?
  * Popularity = Number of units? Average price?
* Are there repeat hosts?
  * If so, what does that mean?
